PROBLEM OVERVIEW
CPSN is a nonprofit that has been a well kept secret for 26 years. They provide an invaluable service by confidentially supporting struggling parents of acting-out teens & adult children and providing them with personalized and actionable plans to bring about change in their behaviors. When parents change their behavior, it motivates their teen & young adult children to change in response. CPSN is nearly 100% operated by members/volunteers.    

Nearly all members have found the group through word-of-mouth. As a result most fundraising donations have come from members/past members. They need an updated website to help raise visibility, provide current resources, and help build their community.

SOLUTION
Design: update website with new compelling visuals along with member stories in an easy to navigate layout to better engage visitors on the site. Improve website responsiveness on mobile. Improve website SEO.
